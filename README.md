# bomb_your_system

This is the bomb_your_system repo. It contain files to destroy your system space. Use with caution when decompressing!
I left a compress.sh in the repo to layer your compression as good as possible. Make sure to have bzip2 and 7zip installed before running the script (these are used for compression).
WARNING!! Script compress_from_base.sh recplicates what I did and so also includes the command to create a 10GB file of nulls and will compress till layer 12. If you want to remove the old compressed tier, compress.sh contains a comment almost at the end of the file which does this and you can include it for compress_from_base.sh
